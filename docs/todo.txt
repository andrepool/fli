create diagram how functions are related

create diagram how processes are related

create data analyzer

add modelsim force and no force to API

use more advanced c functions to show c advantage e.g. and sine function generator

add more explanation in code

get prompt back in transcript window after run -all (if possible)

use generic in vhdl to set filter coefficients in c fir filter

generate bandstop fir filter with matlab

use signal generator to create bode plot (gain/phase) of fir filter
e.g. 2048 different frequencies 

buf SOCK_BUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE above 512kByte works with test server, but not with simulator

does it make sense and is it possible to start the housekeeping process from a timer instead of a trigger on clk or does it make sense to use a clk/100 signal?

check which functions should be static and which not

add xilinx implementation directory, e.g. spartan3 starter kit

add altera implementation directory

change the malloc for command processing by using an ack value for all processes and use check this in the server to deside if we are are ready

test server for socket test in socket (cd socket; make test) should provide better information to client for mti functions

use semaphore to signal functions e.g. server sends semaphore to housekeeping (instead of mutex)

implement tcl client (obsolete because of python client)

use std_logic_vector in dut

use asserts in code (and add aditional target with -DNDEBUG flag to disable this debuging)

add example with POSIX shared memory (see chapter 54) of the Linux Programming Interface" (not required because AF UNIX sockets is realy fast)

socket test with test server should report better values on the client

mti cmd does not return any information in shown in control_application -m e.g. INFO    mti cmd 'noforce /top/d0/cnt' returns ''

mti cmd tcl value is hex instead of decimal

add command that can get a sequence of signal values, so the client can calculate e.g. the max, min, mean and average in block (visible window)

add memory which we efficiently can fill through fli, the address is generated from the counter

correct the vcom dependency rule because the entities are not anymore visiable in the work directory with questasim version 10.2

use an rtl description for the memory, but also a foreign implementation of the memory

report issue Mentor that vish memory usage increases rapidly when moving / updating wave windows, test with ./control_application -l -1

add mti_ForceSignal to api (or mtiSetSignalValue)

add mti_ReleaseSignal to api

add mti_GetSignalValue to api (return value mtiInt32T)

add mti_GetSignalValueIndirect to api

create list of all signals (mti_FindPorts)in the application including their signal_id. for e.g. search with signal name => signal_id => mti_ForceSignal 

replace command to cmd_resp because the field is used for as wel command as response
